# Feature tracker & instructions

## When is it going to be done?
it's hard to say. this project/port is being contributed to on my free time. feel free to fork and create pull requests, i'll highly appreciate it. :)

## Can I use this on other devices using the Exynos 7420 SoC?
er, not really. you may use the kernel from this organization, but you will have to edit the configuration to make it work with your device, aswell use a different device tree!
